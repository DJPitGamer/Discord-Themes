# 🚫 End of Theme Support – No Future Updates

## ❗ Important Announcement

**I'm officially discontinuing the development and maintenance of all Discord themes.**
The recent full UI overhaul by Discord has made it increasingly frustrating to keep up with constant class and structure changes. This was never supposed to be a full-time job.

All themes currently available are the **last working versions before the new UI update**.
They may still work for you if you're using legacy Discord or older class-based interfaces like with **Vencord's Legacy Mode**, but I will no longer provide updates or bugfixes going forward.

## ❓ Why?

> "Discord keeps changing the entire UI too often, and I’ve lost interest in constantly rewriting my themes after every major update. I want to focus on other creative projects without having to play catch-up with a breaking update every few weeks."

## ✅ Existing Themes Still Downloadable

You can still download and use the latest theme versions from the [Releases page](https://github.com/DJPitGamer/Discord-Themes/releases) — but **use them at your own risk**. Compatibility may break over time with future Discord updates.

## 🔗 Installation Instructions (Legacy)

*Instructions for BetterDiscord and Vencord remain below, but are no longer guaranteed to work with the latest Discord builds.*
